# Project Name
> an accordion component

## General info
This is an exercise where I learned how to make this component, an accordion, part of Zell Liew's Learn JavaScript course (lessons Accordion: Building an accordion, Accordion: Event delegation, Accordion: Animations).

## Inspiration
A simple exercise that shows how JavaScript working together with CCS can also be a simple thing to make a website better.

## Technologies
* HTML - 5
* CSS - 3
* JavaScript - ES6

## Status
Exercise done and customized with information from a site I recently worked on, kollektivorort, to think about possible real-life uses in the future.
